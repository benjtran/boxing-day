## About the Project
This was a passion project created during my high school years using the p5.js library. While the code may not follow modern best practices, it’s a fun example of early game development and creative coding. I really enjoyed exploring practical ways to implement interactive features in the game while applying real concepts I learned in my computer science class. Working on this project helped me connect theory to practice, and it truly fostered my passion for software development.
